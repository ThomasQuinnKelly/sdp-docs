= Validate Jenkins

That's it! You've now deployed and configured a local Jenkins instance.

We're going to run through a couple quick steps to ensure that the deployed Jenkins can launch containers as part of the pipeline.

== Create a Pipeline Job

. From the Jenkins home page, select _New Item_ in the lefthand navigation menu.
. Enter a name for the job. "validate" will do.
. Select the _Pipeline_ job type.
. Click _ok_ at the bottom of the screen.

== Configure a Pipeline

. Scroll down to the _Pipeline_ configuration section
. The _Definition_ drop down should already be set to _Jenkins Templating Engine_

[IMPORTANT]
====
This confirms that JTE has been installed successfully
====

. In the _Pipeline Template_ text box, enter:

[source,groovy]
----
docker.image("maven").inside{
    sh "mvn -v" 
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The pipeline configured pulls the latest `maven` image from Docker Hub and executes the command ``mvn -v`` within that container image.

This will validate that the local Jenkins can pull container images, run them, and then execute pipeline commands inside the launched container.

. Click _Save_ at the bottom of the screen.
. This will redirect you back to the job's main page. Click _Build Now_ in the lefthand navigation menu.
. Under _Build History_ select _#1_ to navigate to the build page
. In the lefthand navigation menu, select _Console Output_ to read the build logs
. Confirm that the pipeline successfully pulled the `maven` container image
. Confirm that the command `mvn -v` executed successfully and shows the maven version
. Validate that the build finished successfully.

If all went well, the console output should show something like:
